# Airbnb Segmentation Datasets

This folder contains **sample Airbnb listings datasets** (2024–2025) prepared for **market segmentation analysis**.  
The samples are provided to illustrate the data structure while keeping the repository lightweight.  

These datasets are used to cluster listings into distinct **market segments** (e.g., budget vs. premium, family vs. solo traveler focus), helping to uncover meaningful customer and property groupings across New Zealand.

## 📝 Mini Metadata
Each monthly file (`*_sample.csv`) includes variables commonly used for segmentation, such as:  
- **Property Characteristics** – room type, accommodates, bedrooms, amenities  
- **Pricing Variables** – nightly rate, cleaning fee, minimum nights  
- **Host Features** – number of listings, host response rate  
- **Location Info** – neighbourhood, latitude/longitude  
- **Review Metrics** – number of reviews, average review scores  

These features support clustering methods like **k-means** and **k-prototypes** to identify actionable market segments.
