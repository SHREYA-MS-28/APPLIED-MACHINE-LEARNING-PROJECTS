#  Hubble Contact Lenses: Data-Driven Direct-to-Consumer Marketing  

##  Project Overview  
This project analyzes **Hubble Contact Lenses**, a direct-to-consumer (DTC) startup disrupting the U.S. contact lens market. Using a **Harvard Business Review case study**, the analysis evaluates Hubble’s **business model, customer acquisition strategies, and media mix efficiency** while exploring the risks and opportunities of scaling a data-driven DTC brand.  

The study highlights how **digital machine learning–driven marketing** (e.g., Facebook/Instagram ad targeting, attribution modeling, and cross-channel testing) shaped Hubble’s growth trajectory—and what strategic moves were necessary to sustain profitability.

##  Key Objectives  
- **Evaluate Hubble’s Business Model**: Strengths of the subscription-based DTC approach and risks in scaling.  
- **Customer Acquisition & Retention**: Efficiency of CAC vs. LTV and areas for improvement in churn management.  
- **Media Analysis**: Role of **owned, earned, and paid media**, and the balance between online and offline channels.  
- **Attribution Challenges**: Issues in measuring ad effectiveness across Facebook, TV, podcasts, and multi-touch campaigns.  
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Diversification, retention strategies, and advanced attribution models.

##  Methodology  
1. **Case Study Review** – Harvard Business School case *“Hubble Contact Lenses: Data-Driven Direct-to-Consumer Marketing.”*  
2. **Analytical Frameworks** – CAC vs. LTV analysis, media mix modeling, and DTC scaling principles.  
3. **Insights & Recommendations** – Practical strategies to mitigate platform dependency and improve retention.

##  Insights & Findings  
- Hubble achieved **$20M in revenue within 18 months**, leveraging **social-media-first acquisition**.  
- CAC averaged **$77.81 (prospecting)** vs. **$38.06 (retargeting)**, with a customer LTV of ~$264.  
- Heavy dependence on **Facebook ads (61% spend)** created long-term scalability risks.  
- Offline media (TV, podcasts) showed strong **halo effects**, boosting digital conversions.  
- Retention (8 months on average) was solid but required stronger **segmentation and personalization** to extend LTV.

##  Strategic Outlook  
For sustainable growth, Hubble must:  
- **Diversify media** beyond Facebook to mitigate rising CPMs.  
- Invest in **owned media & CRM** (apps, lifecycle email flows, loyalty programs).  
- Expand **earned media** through referrals, influencers, and user-generated content.
